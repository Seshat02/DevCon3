Players control a getaway car navigating crowded streets while being relentlessly pursued by a chasing car. Strategy, reflexes, and deep knowledge of the city layout are crucial to reaching the end checkpoint and evading capture.

**Genre:** Action, Racing

**Setting:** Modern Urban Cityscape

**Platform:** PC, Console

**Objective:** The player’s goal is to reach the designated end checkpoint while avoiding the pursuer. Players must use speed, cunning, and the environment to outmaneuver their relentless chaser.

## Gameplay Mechanics
### Pursuer AI (scrapped)
**Description:** An AI-driven car that relentlessly chases the player, adapting to their moves and speed.
- **Impact:** Increases tension and creates dynamic, unpredictable gameplay.
- **Purpose:** To challenge the players to strategize and think quickly
- **Use Case:** The pursuer will use shortcuts and aggressive driving tactics to close the gap.

### Power-ups (scrapped)
**Description:** Scattered throughout the city are power-ups that provide temporary advantages.
**Examples:**
- **Oil Puddle:** Drops oil behind the car, causing the pursuer to slow down.
- **Turbo Boost:** Temporarily increases speed.
- **Impact:** Adds strategy and unpredictability to the gameplay.
- **Purpose:** To give the players tools to outsmart the pursuer.
- **Use Case:** Players strategically use power-ups at critical moments to escape close calls

## Objective Statement
### Purpose
To create an exhilarating chase experience that tests the players’ reflexes, decision-making, and ability to adapt to a high-pressure environment
### How We Plan To Achieve This
- Dynamic AI that adjusts to player behaviour, keeping the tension high
- An urban environment full of obstacles, shortcuts, and opportunities for clever escapes
- Strategic power-ups to provide thrilling moments of advantage

—
## Emotional Engagement
We want the players to feel the adrenaline rush of being pursued, the exhilaration of narrow escapes, and the satisfaction of outsmarting their pursuers. The combination of a high-speed chase, a reactive AI, and an urban setting creates a deeply immersive experience.

—
## Why This Design?
This design leverages the classic “Cops and Robbers” chases, with modernized dynamic AI, and an environmental storytelling. The blend of strategy, reflex-based gameplay, and player choice ensures a unique and replayable experience.

—
## Intended Player Reactions
- **Excitement:** High-speed chases through an unpredictable urban setting.
- **Tension:** The neverending presence of a relentless pursuer.
- **Satisfaction:** Successfully outmaneuvering the pursuer and reaching the end checkpoint

## Design Rationale
- **Pursuer AI**
The AI was designed to give a challenging yet fair opponent that adapts to the player’s moves. The early prototype showed that the AI followed a set path that needed balance and was also too aggressive as it kept driving into the player's car, we also found that making it too passive removed the sense of danger.
The solution we came up with was to introduce adaptive difficulty, where the AI’s tactics adjust based on the player’s performance.
- **Environmental Hazards (scrapped)**
Hazards were carefully placed to create a natural flow through the city. Testing revealed that players enjoyed finding alternate routes so shortcuts and alleyways were added for a more strategic depth.
- **Power-ups (scrapped)**
Power-ups were implemented to give players creative ways to escape. The oil slick was refined to balance risk and reward. 
Limiting the availability of power-ups ensured that they felt impactful without being overpowered.

## Questions
- How does the pursuer AI impact player strategy and tension?
- Are the environmental hazards challenging yet fair for players?
- Do the power-ups provide meaningful advantages and promote replayability?
